This repository contains the files, scripts, and documentation related to the Operating System (OS) Upgrade Project for a Bank. The primary goal of this project is to upgrade the bank's current operating systems across its network infrastructure, ensuring improved security, compatibility, and performance. The upgrade will be executed in stages, starting from planning, testing in a staging environment, and finally rolling out the OS upgrade to all branches of the bank.

Project Objectives
OS Upgrade: Upgrade the current OS (e.g., Windows Server 2016) to a newer, more secure and efficient version (e.g., Windows Server 2022 or a Linux-based system).
Minimize Downtime: Ensure minimal disruption to bank operations during the upgrade process.
Data Security: Implement strong backup and recovery procedures to avoid any data loss during the upgrade.
Compatibility Testing: Ensure that all banking software and hardware are compatible with the new OS.
Post-Upgrade Support: Provide continued support and training for the IT team to handle post-upgrade issues and maintain the system.
